## 🧑‍💻 Concepts Learned
This project helped me practice and understand:
- **Functions** → dividing logic into small reusable parts  
- **Global vs Local Variables** → managing ticket counts across functions  
- **Loops (`while True`)** → building menu-driven programs  
- **Conditional Statements (`if-elif-else`)** → handling user choices  
- **Input Validation** → preventing invalid bookings or cancellations  
- **User-Friendly CLI** → simple and clear console interface
